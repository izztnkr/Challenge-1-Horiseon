## Criteria

A webpage meets accessibility standards:

~ When I view the source code then I find semantic HTML elements.

~ When I view the structure of the HTML elements then I find that the elements follow a 
  logical structure independent of styling and positioning.

~ When I view the image elements then I find accessible alt attributes.

~ When I view the heading attributes then they fall in sequential order.

~ When I view the title element then I find a concise, descriptive title.


## Contributions
~ Checked all links are in working order

~ Added alt values to images

~ Matched Webpage Title element to "Horiseon"

~ Consolidated and commented in Style.css for ease of use and semantic structure.

~ Adjusted HTML for semantic structure.
